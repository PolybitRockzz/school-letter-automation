Respected Ma'am, 

We highly respect the decisions made by you and other respected staff of your school for the sole benefit of our ward. However, I'm writing this e-mail to bring light to the genuine problems faced by my ward, (your full name) of  class (your class and section) in attending the Saturday classes:-

1. There are classes from institutes which prepare them for important government college entrance exams, whose schedules cannot be changed. I hope you understand the importance of such trainings for their career.

2. My ward is not recieving enough time for self-study which is equally important for performing good in academics, besides the completion of the syllabus by the school.

3. Although, they are willing to attend those classes, and have shifted tuition timings, they cannot attend offline school on Saturdays as tuitions are colliding with their travel time.

4. There is an unnecessary lowering of their attendance, keeping which in mind, they are prevented from taking leaves during their ill-health, in order to maintain 75% attendance.

So, I hereby request you to make these classes available online so, that atleast students, who are willing can attend them.

Thanks & Regards,
(Your Guardian's full name).
